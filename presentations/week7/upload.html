    <h1>Sarah's Desktop VS. Mobile.</h1>
    <h3> I chose to make a minimalistic site on both the mobile and desktop options because I believe that it is easier for the viewers to understand and use the site. I chose a black and white theme because I think it looks very sleek and professional and can help catch an audiences eye to the more important things on the website. I chose to include things such as location and contact information because it is a business and customers are going to need that information to express their interests or visit the store in person. Having this information will make your store more accessable. </h3>
